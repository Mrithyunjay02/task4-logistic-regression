Task 4 â€“ Logistic Regression

In this task, I worked on a classification problem using logistic regression. The objective was to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign using medical data.

What I did:
- Used the Breast Cancer dataset from Scikit-learn
- Standardized the features for better model performance
- Split the data into training and test sets
- Trained a logistic regression model
- Evaluated the model using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score
- Plotted the ROC curve to visualize model performance

Tools used:
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Outcome:
The model achieved strong performance in identifying malignant versus benign tumors. I also learned how logistic regression uses the sigmoid function to make binary predictions.
